# dv - A command line tool to remove AWS default VPC(s)

I created this tool to get me familiar with Golang. Just install a binary from the release page and then hit `dv help` so that you would understand how to use this tiny tool. One thing to note. `ls` subcommand is extremely slow now. I think goroutine, which I don't get for now ;), can make me happy.

A way of removing default VPCs from [delete-aws-default-vpc](https://github.com/davidobrien1985/delete-aws-default-vpc).
